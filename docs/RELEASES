0.7.0 - Added red-by-last KOS checking.

        Changed default font sizes to be not customized for my weird 150% in a VM on a
        4k screen size.

0.6.3 - Add the ability to kos-check people by right-click/Copy of links pasted into
        chat.

        Resets default sounds if previous run abended in a way that cause blank values
        to be written to the config.

0.6.2 - Added user-agent to network requests.

        Fixed bug that affected loading of line color on some themes.

        Parser cleanup.

        Misc obsolete code cleanup.

0.6.1 - Add MP4 support for info dialog.

0.6.0 - Unified theme customization dialog.

        Added ability to use real SVG's for background, instead of converting them to
        pixmaps at load time.

        Additonal theme customization parameters.

0.5.3 - Updated info dialog and added some additional sounds.

0.5.2 - Clear messages were unintentionally being accepted from any channel.

0.5.1 - Added SVG support for backgrounds.

        Fixed centering bug that would occur when a very large background was replaced
        with a smaller image.

        Centralized functionality to get paths to app files so it could be abstracted to
        behave differently under different OSes and conditions.  This allows for a real
        Linux installer to put it in the standard directories instead of just running
        from the user's home directory.

0.5.0 - Added ability to click systems and see the related messages.

        Added Find|Messages option that lets you subset to messages that contain a certain
        string.

        Added the ability to set a background image, which is saved with themes.

        Now doesn't occasionally reposition the map to center on your system when you
        didn't really change systems.

        Change z ordering for jumpbridges to draw on top of lines, which makes them easier
        to follow if you're using a theme with thick system connection lines.


0.4.0 - Converted from using massaged dotlan maps with injected XML to deconstructing them
        on load and building my own object instances.  This improves performance and lays
        groundwork for total system theming.

        Locked system icons so that they will not be affected by rotation of map.

        Made system name and time font/size configurable and is now included in themes.

        Fixed a crash that would sometimes occur when switching map to other regions.

        Fixed some missing logic that would cause changes to the options for map-refresh,
        auto-follow period, and poller-refresh to not actually take effect until restart.

        Added some primitive size-hinting so that longer messages get more vertical
        space in their listview.

0.3.0 - Added pilots menu and the ability to disable processing for individual pilots to
        accomodate multi-boxers.

        Additional theming updates.

0.2.2 - Fix for multiboxes only seeing last logged on char.

0.2.1 - Minor fixes.  First release shared with corp.

0.2.0 - Added jumpbridges, basic theming, and more options.

0.1.0 - First QSvgRenderer version, first Windows build.

0.0.2 - Added rules, a bunch of configuration, and wasted tons of time trying to get the
0.0.9   map working reliably with QWebEngine.  Even more wasted time trying to compile
        QWebKit on Windows when it became clear QWebEngine was not functional enough
        to meet the requirements at this time.

0.0.1 - Original QWebKit version on Linux with working map, parser, configurable sounds.
