Jumpbridge data should be stored in a plain text file, named the same as the
map (except all lowercase).  The file should be placed in the directory
pointed to in settings|options|map(tab)|"Bridge Data".

For instance, if your bridge data directory is set to
"http://eternaldusk.com/imp/jb/", a map for Providence would be located in
the file at "http://eternaldusk.com/imp/jb/providence".

The contents of the file should follow this format:

FirstSystem=SecondSystem:#RGBcolorInHex


Example:

3D-CQU=9UY4-H:#0F00FF
3KB-J0=AY-YCU:#804030
49GC-R=8B-VLX:#1F00EF
5KG-PY=QBL-BV:#2F00DF
7YWV-S=N8XA-L:#3F00CF
...

You can "comment-out" bridges that are temporarily down by replacing the
'=' with another character, like '?'.  For instance "3D-CQU?9UY4-H:#0F00FF"
would not be shown on the map and would be ignored.
