Themes are stored in different locations, depending on the type.  The default themes
are in a subdirectory of the application, which may be updated/changed on every new
release.  User created themes are written to IMP's application data directory (unique
per user), where they will persist through updates.

Users cannot save themes with the same name as a default theme.

The user theme directories on the different operating systems, by default, are:

      Linux:  ~/.local/share/EternalDusk/IMP/themes
    Windows:  C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Local\EternalDusk\IMP\themes

- Each theme writes to their own subdirectory within the themes folder.

- When saving a theme, it copies any assets (graphics, and in the future - sounds)
  to its own folder.  This will make it easy to share themes, since you only have
  to zip/send the theme's subdirectory and not worry about the paths to the assets.
