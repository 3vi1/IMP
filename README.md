---------------------------------------

IMP converts Eve Online channel chat into audio visual queues, letting you observe the state of Eve star systems and receive alerts in a more efficient manner.  

* IMP's map is themeable and rotatable.
* All alert sounds are customizable.
* New rules can be created to fire user defined actions.
  * Rules can be configured to act upon any open channel, not just intel channels.
  * Rules use regular-expressions in every field for extreme flexibility.

The latest binary releases are available on [the releases page](https://github.com/3vi1/IMP/releases).

Linux installation packages are in progress.  Until then, you can download the source and build by following the instructions in the INSTALL.md file.
